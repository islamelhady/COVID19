## Features
- View the **Total COVID19 cases worldwide** from a reliable [API](https://github.com/NovelCOVID/API) source.
- Receive notifications of the total cases every hour using WorkManager.
- Search for COVID19 numbers for any country using Retrofit and Moshi.
- Visualize the statistics on linear charts using LiveData and DataBinding.
- Read COVID19 related news from the W.H.O. and Google News RSS using Coroutines and Flow.
- Access the app offline using Cache.

*It uses `PeriodicWorkManager` which is scheduled at the first run of an app. After that, `Worker` will execute after every one hour of interval and will show notification on Android's system tray.*

## Tech Stack 
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - The official and first-class programming language for Android development.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - For managing concurrency and asynchronous tasks.
- [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-flow/) - A cold asynchronous data stream that sequentially emits values and completes normally or with an exception.
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
  - [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - Data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
  - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes. 
  - [DataBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding) - that allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.
- [Koin](https://start.insert-koin.io/) - Dependency Injection Framework (Kotlin)
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
- [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) - A modern JSON library for Kotlin and Java.
- [Moshi Converter](https://github.com/square/retrofit/tree/master/retrofit-converters/moshi) - A Converter which uses Moshi for serialization to and from JSON.
- [WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager) - An API that makes it easy to schedule deferrable, asynchronous tasks that are expected to run even if the app exits or device restarts.
- [Material Components for Android](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) - Modular and customizable Material Design UI components for Android
